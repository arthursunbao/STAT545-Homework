## About this folder
Hi Everyone!

This is the folder for STAT545 Homework 10 : Data from the Web: Scrape the dataset

![Direct Link to the File](https://github.com/arthursunbao/foofactors "Direct Link to the File")

I will continue working with the **Make API queries “by hand” using httr** and **Scrape the web** as the latter one was the work we had during the course, which will be easier to pickup.

## Requirement For The Work

Work through the final set of slides from the rOpenSci UseR! 2016 workshop. This will give you basic orientation, skills, and pointers on the rvest package.

Scrape a multi-record dataset off the web! Convert it into a clean and tidy data frame. Store that as a file ready for (hypothetical!) downstream analysis. Do just enough basic exploration of the resulting data, possibly including some plots, that you and a reader are convinced you’ve successfully downloaded and cleaned it.

I think it’s dubious to scrape data that is available through a proper API, so if you do that anyway … perhaps you should get the data both ways and reflect on the comparison. Also, make sure you not violating a site’s terms of service or your own ethical standards with your webscraping. Just because you can, it doesn’t mean you should!
