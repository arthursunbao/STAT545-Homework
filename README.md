This is Bao Sun's First Course Work for STAT545
=====================

Hi Everyone!

My name is Bao Sun (Jason) and I am a second year master student of ECE. Very glad to be a member of STAT545!

I am never used R before and I am quite interested in the amazing functionality of R in data science.

I am looking forward to learning more new things and do more work in data science !
