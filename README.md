This is Bao Sun's First Course Work for STAT545
=====================

### Self Introduction
Hi Everyone!
My name is Bao Sun (Jason) and I am a second year master student of ECE. Very glad to be a member of STAT545!
I am never used R before and I am quite interested in the amazing functionality of R in data science.
I am looking forward to learning more new things and do more work in data science !

My Github account is at here: <https://github.com/arthursunbao>.
My Linkedin account is at here: <https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonsunb/>.

My previous experience lays mainly in software engineering with development experience in Java and C++. I am very interested in data science as I am fully convenienced that the world are changing into a world of data and that is the reason why I take the course

### Current Course Plan
Here is a list of to-do list I want to achieve in the course in the future.
- Learn the basic usage of R
- Markdown Usage in R and write independent blog with R
- Do some research on simple R machine learning algorithm
- Get a good score of this course

### How do I edit the README.MD?
Actually I edited the README.MD from Mac Terminal by Vim, RStudio and Github Web by all means as I want to practise to see the difference between them. 
Of course it is easier to do within Vim as I have been using Vim for quite some time :)
Furthermore, I do all the git operations for git add, git commit, git push orign master from terminal as I have been using Git for quite some time....
I think it is very interesting and worthwhile to use Git to do iterative development for R document like other software development methodologies. 

### I love UBC
What a beautiful scenary of UBC !
