### About this folder
Hi Everyone!

This is the folder for STAT545 Homework 8 : Building Shiny apps


![Here is the link to the webapp](https://jasonsunbao.shinyapps.io/hw08/ "Shiny Webapp")

Basically we will do the following work

- Add an image of the BC Liquor Store to the UI. Hint: Place the image in a folder named www, and use img(src = "imagename.png") to add the image

- Use the DT package to turn the current results table into an interactive table

- Show the number of results found whenever the filters change

- Allow the user to download the results.
