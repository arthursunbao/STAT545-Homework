=====================

### About this folder
Hi Everyone!

This is the folder for STAT545 Homework5: Factor and figure management; Repo hygiene


![Direct Link to the File](https://github.com/arthursunbao/STAT545-Homework/blob/master/hw04/Tidy_data_and_joins.md "Direct Link to the File")

Basically we will do the following work

- Reorder a factor in a principled way based on the data and demonstrate the effect in arranged data and in figures.

- Improve a figure (or make one from scratch), using new knowledge, e.g., control the color scheme, use factor levels, smoother mechanics.
- Implement visualization design principles.

- Write some data to file and load it back into R. E.g., save a plot to file and include it in a R Markdown report via ![Alt text](/path/to/img.png).

- Organise your github, to celebrate the completion of STAT 545 and/or to prepare for the glorious future of STAT 547.
