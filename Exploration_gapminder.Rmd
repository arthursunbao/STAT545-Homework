## Intro

This is an intro document for introducing the exploration of gapminder dataset, which is a very famous dataset in R package and data science. 
I will use some basic R commands to show you the overview of gapminder dataset and I found that the R commands are very much like the pandas dataframe in Python :)

## Overview

Gapminder is a dataset like this, we first need to install the dataset using library(gapminder)

All right, after that the gapminder dataset is already loaded into RAM and now we can take a look at the general structure of it. We can use head(gapminder), which will show the first several lines of gapminder dataset.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(gapminder)
head(gapminder)
```
