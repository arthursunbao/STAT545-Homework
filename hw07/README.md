Basically we will do the following work

- Write (or extract from a previous analysis) three or more R scripts to carry out a small data analysis.

- The output of the first script must be the input of the second, and so on.

- First script: download some data.

- Second script: read the data, perform some analysis and write numerical data to file in CSV or TSV format.

- Third script: read the output of the second script, generate some figures and save them to files.

- Fourth script: an Rmd, actually, that presents original data, the statistical summaries, and/or the figures in a little report.

- A fifth script to rule them all, i.e. to run the others in sequence
