### About this folder
Hi Everyone!

This is the folder for STAT545 Homework3: Use dplyr and ggplot2 to manipulate and explore gapminder dataset


![Direct Link to the File](https://github.com/arthursunbao/STAT545-hw01--Bao-Sun/blob/master/Exploration_gapminder.md "Direct Link to the File")

Basically we will introduce the dataset according to these following fields: 

- Get the maximum and minimum of GDP per capita for all continents.

- Look at the spread of GDP per capita within the continents

- Compute a trimmed mean of life expectancy for different years. Or a weighted mean, weighting by population. Just try something other than the plain vanilla mean

- Find out the life expectancy changing over time on different continents

- Report the absolute and/or relative abundance of countries with low life expectancy over time by continent: Compute some measure of worldwide life expectancy by mean or median or some other quantile or perhaps your current age. Then determine how many countries on each continent have a life expectancy less than this benchmark, for each year

- Find countries with interesting stories. Open-ended and, therefore, hard. Promising but unsuccessful attempts are encouraged. This will generate interesting questions to follow up on in class
Hope you can enjoy this page and have a wonderful time :)
